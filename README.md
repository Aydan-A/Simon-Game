# Simon Game

This project is a simple Simon Game, where users must replicate a sequence of colors and sounds in the correct order. As the game progresses, the sequence gets longer, and the user must continue to remember the correct order.

Features  
• Randomly generated color sequence that increases in length as the player progresses.  
• Interactive buttons that light up and play sounds when clicked.  
• Game over state with an option to restart the game.  
• Levels displayed to track progress.  

Game Flow
Sequence Generation: The game randomly generates a sequence of colors that increases with each round.
User Interaction: The player must repeat the sequence by clicking the corresponding buttons. The game checks the user’s input for accuracy.
Game Over: If the user clicks an incorrect button, the game ends, and they can start over.
